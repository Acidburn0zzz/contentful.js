This is the reference documentation for contentful.js, the JavaScript SDK for [Contentful's](https://www.contentful.com) Content Delivery API.

TODO
* Add more examples for the various methods
* Fix the bottom margin on dl's for types
* Figure out how to deploy for each library version and redirect the index page
* Maybe try to use Avenir as a font and fallback to the current One
* see if there's any Contentful color tweaks that can be done

To get started, follow the instructions on the [Github Project Page](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js).

If you've already done so, the first thing you want to look at is the [`contentful`](./contentful.html) namespace.

Here's a quick description of the other namespaces:
* [`CDAClient`](./CDAClient.html) - The main client object, which provides the methods to get entities out of Contentful such as Entries, Assets and Content Types.
* [`Entities`](./Entities.html) - Defines properties and methods for each of the different entities you'll find in Contentful.
* [`EntryFields`](./EntryFields.html) - Defines the different kinds of fields you will find in Entries.
* [`Sync`](./Sync.html) - Defines the types used when working with the [Synchronization](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/sync/) endpoint
